ISSUES:

 * Support delayed or hidden debconf questions

Unresolved issues can be discussed at the following wiki page:
http://wiki.debian.org/PackageKit


TODO:

 * Implement all open backend methods. A list of implemented backend methods 
   can be found in PackageKit FAQ or in pk-backend-apt.c.

 * Blacklist packages requiring input on the terminal and try to change
   the Debian policy in the long run. Way of automation?
 
 * Allow to reinject debtags into the search results to get 
   similar software which not matches on the search terms

 * Index file list and add properties for package name and section to
   the xapian database to also make use of it in search group and 
   search name (do we want this?)

 * Test and think about packages from cdroms

 * Talk to Sebastian Dr√∂ge about his new codec search implementation using
   debtags
