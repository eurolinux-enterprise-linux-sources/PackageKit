ruck is a rug-like interface for PackageKit
('rug' is the command-line interface for rcd, red carpet daemon.)


Answers to some Frequently Asked Questions:
-------------------------------------------

* You got to be kidding me, yet another package management tool?
No, not really. ruck is just an alternative command line interface
for PackageKit

* What's wrong pkcon?
The main reason of writing ruck is for a couple of lazy people who
got used to Red Carpet's cli 'rug' and are unable to learn any
new tricks.

* Anything else?
Glad you asked, yes! It's really easy to extend ruck. Just drop the
implementation of your new commands to $prefix/share/ruck/commands/
directory and ruck will find them.
