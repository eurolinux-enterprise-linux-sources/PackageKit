packagekit-sharp: a managed binding for packagekit-glib, usable in Mono and .NET.

The binding's code is autogenerated, so do not edit any files under the generated/
folder or changes will be lost.

Generating packagekit-api.raw:
------------------------------
This file is the raw output of the parsing of packagekit-glib. You only need to
regenerate it if the pk-glib API was changed.

To regenerate, just run:
> make api

Note: this require gapi2-parser, ususally found in the gtk-sharp-2.0 or gtk-gapi
package.

Massaging the raw api, customizing generated sources
----------------------------------------------------
the raw api file can be adapted via a list of rules in PackageKit.metadata. In
addition to this, you can also add custom code in a .custom file in the main
directory.

If you modify the PackageKit.metadata file, packagekit-api.xml will be regenerated
before generating the code.

Note: this require gapi2-fixup ang gapi2-codegen.

Building
--------
type "make", it'll build packagekit-sharp.dll
